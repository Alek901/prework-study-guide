## Usage

This study guide will help you understand the basics to HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. Within this syudy guide you can find the basic layout of each file and see how it looks. In the HTML section you will see how it is formated and how it affects the webpage, such as bullet points or ul and li, as well as the body and headers.
In the CSS section you will find how CSS improves the webpage by helping the reader read more enjoyably. Before CSS you would only find black words on the page and it would be very boring to read. But with CSS we can improve the H1-h6 and our body by includeing code that changes the backround color or font size etc. You will find how each code in CSS can impact the webpage.
In the JavaScript section you can find how it affects the console in our webpage and how to program it to be random or a selcetive loop. You will see how we use for to impact our console script.
